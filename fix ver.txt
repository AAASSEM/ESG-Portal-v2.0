Looking at your files, I can see the issue. The problem is in your ResetPassword.js component - it's calling sendVerificationCode() in the useEffect, but that function is trying to call an endpoint at /api/auth/send-reset-code/, and there's a mismatch in how it's handling the response.
Let me fix the SendResetCodeView and VerifyResetCodeView in your Django backend to work properly:Fixed auth_views.py - SendResetCodeView and VerifyResetCodeViewCodeÂ # Add these updated views to your auth_views.py file
# Replace the existing SendResetCodeView and VerifyResetCodeView classes

@method_decorator(csrf_exempt, name='dispatch')
class SendResetCodeView(APIView):
    """
    View to send password reset vNow, let's also check your Django server restart procedure and make sure the updated code is being used:
Steps to Apply the Fix:
1. First, update your auth_views.py with the code above (replace the existing SendResetCodeView and VerifyResetCodeView classes)
2. Restart your Django server properly:
bash# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart with:
python manage.py runserver

# Or if you're using a different port:
python manage.py runserver 8000
3. Clear Django's cache (if you have caching enabled):
bashpython manage.py clear_cache
# Or
python manage.py shell
>>> from django.core.cache import cache
>>> cache.clear()
4. Test directly with curl or Postman:
bash# Test the send-reset-code endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/send-reset-code/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "your-test-email@example.com"}'
5. Check Django logs:
The updated code includes print statements that will help debug. Watch your Django console output when making the request.
Key Changes Made:

Added detailed logging with print statements to track the request flow
Simplified error handling to catch and report specific errors
Made the endpoint work for both authenticated and unauthenticated users
Returns the hardcoded verification code '654321' for testing
Properly structured response to match what your frontend expects

If It Still Doesn't Work:

Check if there's middleware intercepting the request:
Look in your settings.py for any custom middleware that might be catching errors.
Check your Django URL configuration:
Make sure there's no duplicate URL pattern that might be matching first.
Try accessing the endpoint directly in your browser:
http://localhost:8000/api/auth/send-reset-code/
You should see a "Method Not Allowed" error for GET, which confirms the endpoint exists.
Add this debug endpoint temporarily to test if your changes are being applied:
python@method_decorator(csrf_exempt, name='dispatch')
class TestResetCodeView(APIView):
    permission_classes = [AllowAny]
    
    def get(self, request):
        return Response({'test': 'Working!', 'time': str(timezone.now())})
And add to urls.py:
pythonpath('auth/test-reset/', TestResetCodeView.as_view(), name='test-reset'),


The issue is likely that your Django server needs to be properly restarted or there's a caching issue preventing your updates from taking effect. The code I provided should work once it's properly loaded by Django.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
